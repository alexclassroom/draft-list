# Draft List

Draft List allows you to both manage your draft and scheduled posts more easily but also to promote them by showing them on your site via shortcode or widget - use it to show your visitors what's "coming soon" or as a great SEO tool.

How easy is it display a list of draft posts? Here's an example of how you could use it in a post or page...

`[drafts limit=5 type=post order=ma scheduled=no template='{{ul}}{{draft}} {{icon}}']`

This would display a list of up to 5 draft posts in ascending modified date sequence, with an icon displayed to the right of each if the draft is scheduled.

Features include...

* Quick links added to admin menu for going straight to your draft posts and pages
* Menu links show the number of drafts you currently have
* Widget/shortcode output is highly configurable - create your own look by using a template, identify scheduled posts with an icon, sequence the results in various ways and even narrow down the results to a specific timeframe
* Click on any of the drafts posts listed to edit them
* Output is cached for streamlined performance
* A meta box in the editor screen allows you to omit individual posts from any list outputs
