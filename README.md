# Draft List

<img src="https://ps.w.org/simple-draft-list/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">Draft List allows you to promote your unpublished posts by showing them on your site via a shortcode or widget - use it to show your visitors what's "coming soon" or as a great SEO tool.

How easy is it display a list of unpublished posts? Here's an example of how you could use it in a post or page...

`[drafts limit=5 type=post order=ma scheduled=no template='{{ul}}{{draft}} {{icon}}']`

This would display a list of up to 5 draft posts in ascending modified date sequence, with an icon displayed to the right of each if the draft is scheduled.

Features include...

* Widget/shortcode output is highly configurable - create your own look by using a template, identify scheduled posts with an icon, sequence the results in various ways and even narrow down the results to a specific timeframe
* If you're logged in, click on any of the posts listed to edit them
* Output is cached for streamlined performance
* A meta box in the editor screen allows you to omit individual posts from any list output
